# pypkpd  
**pypkpd** is a computing package inspired by PopED project. Achieving the same purpose, pypkpd helps to compute optimal experimental designs for both population and individual studies based on nonlinear mixed-effect models.   

The original version called PopED is built in the R environment and has contributed appreciably to the analysis of scholars studying population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Considering the popularity of Python, we hope to realize similar functions in the Python environment.
